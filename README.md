<p><h2>What is COVID-19? </h2> 
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. &apos;CO&apos; stands for corona, &apos;VI&apos; for virus, and 
&apos;D&apos; for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as &apos;2019 novel coronavirus&apos; or &apos;2019-nCoV.&apos;The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.  </p>
<p><h2>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?   </h2>
Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause 
pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19.Thisis why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. </p>
<p><h2> How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>
 <b>The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing).Individuals can also be infected fromand touching surfaces contaminated with the virusand touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.</b></p>
